The dynamics of a physical system is usually determined by solving a differential equation. 
It normally proceeds by reducing the differential equation to a familiar form with known compact solution using suitable coordinate transformations. In nontrivial cases however, finding the appropriate transformation is difficult and numerical methods are used. A number of algorithms (e.g., Runge-Kutta, finite difference, etc) are available for calculating the solution accurately and efficiently. However, these methods are sequential and require much memory space and time, as a result have great computational cost. Here, we demonstrate an ANN approach to finding solutions of Parabolic Partial Differential Equation (PPDE). We use an unsupervised feed forward Neural Network to solve. We illustrate the method by solving a variety of PPDE model problems including Burgerâ€™s equation that is the one-dimensional quasi-linear PPDE.
